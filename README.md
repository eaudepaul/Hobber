Hobber is an mobile web app where users who love playing games can sign up to get matched with other users with the same gaming interests. Register on Hobber, complete your profile and upload a profile picture, add games you love to play, and start matching away!

After matching with other users, gamers can chat 1:1 with their matches, schedule appointments to play, and cultivate new friendships.
